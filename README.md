# AI & ML Internship Tasks – CODXINTERN

**Submitted by:** Sameer Gandhi  
**Domain:** Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  
**Internship Duration:** 27th October 2025 - 27th November 2025  

This repository contains the two internship tasks I completed during the CODXINTERN program.  
Both projects show how AI and Machine Learning can be applied to real-world problems.

## Tasks Overview

### 1️⃣ Spam Mail Detector
**Goal:** Detect whether a message is spam or not (ham).  

**Included Files:**
- `pamdetector.py` – Python code for training the model and predicting messages  
- `spam_data.json` – Dataset containing sample messages  

**What I did:**
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Preprocessed text: lowercase, removed stopwords, tokenization  
- Converted text into numeric features using Bag of Words / TF-IDF  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained a Naive Bayes classifier  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, and F1-score  
- Created an interactive mode to test messages  

**Skills gained:** Text preprocessing, feature extraction, NLP basics, classification modeling

### 2️⃣ House Price Prediction
**Goal:** Predict house prices based on numerical features.  

**Included Files:**
- `housepriceprediction.py` – Python code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation  

**What I did:**
- Loaded the California Housing dataset  
- Explored and visualized the data  
- Handled missing values and normalized features  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score
